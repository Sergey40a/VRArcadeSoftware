Opensource Virtual Reality Arcade Management System (BSD v3 License)

The story:
3 years ago, me and my friends had the idea to open a virtual reality arcade. So, we started preparing, register company, finding store location, researching VR game, contact game developer and finding a system we can use to manage our perspective virtual reality arcade store.

I am a software & electronic engineer with 19 years of experience and since we didn’t find any good virtual reality arcade management system at the time, I started developing our very own virtual reality arcade management system. It took me about 8 months and 22,000+ lines of code to finally complete the software and 1 more month to do internal test to work out everything smoothly. 

We went through all the initial hiccup of starting a business, such as renovation, permit, purchase and figure out a path when plan doesn’t fall all right in etc. The arcade was open. We laugh, we cry, we work hard. It was a quite good run for 2 years. At a point the beginning of this year we finally decide to close the store as the rising rent are eroding all of the profit – our own mistake of setting up store in super high-rent mall entry units. 

So, we were where we were. The virtual reality arcade management system became the legacy of my closed store. Through here I would like to contribute the virtual reality arcade management system to the great virtual reality arcade operator community and the people like you. It’s fully functional and stable, free of charge and will remain free in the future!
