If you need thermal printer function please install thermal printer drive first. (I use Epson TM-T20II mPOS Thermal Receipt Printer)

After installing the thermal printer please install POS for .Net v1.12 as this is bridge between .NET program and the printer drive.

You will also need to config the default thermal printer instance on dev and target machine, check printer's user manual for detailed steps.
